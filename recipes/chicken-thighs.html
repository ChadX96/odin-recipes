        <h2>Garlic-Brown Sugar Chicken Thighs</h2>

        <p>Delicious tasting chicken with a sweet, crunchy skin.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>8 each bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Add chicken, skin-side down, and sear until brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. 
                Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining butter in the skillet. 
                Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Remove from heat and stir in brown sugar, honey, oregano, thyme, 
                and basil until well combined. Return chicken to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone 
                and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone 
                should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
